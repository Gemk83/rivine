 # SPV, Simplified Payment Verification

 ## Problem 
 The  thin client  implementation through the explorers requires trust in the explorers  even though a thin client can call multiple, it still exposes quite some information to the explorers as well. A more secure thin client implementation like [bitcoin SPV](https://bitcoin.org/en/developer-guide#simplified-payment-verification-spv)  combined with bloomfilters would be better.
