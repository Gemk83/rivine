# Releasenotes Rivine v1.0.6

## Summary

- Bug fixes and improvements;
- MultiSignature condition/fulfillment to allow MultiSig wallets;
- Detailed documentation about transactions as well as MultiSig;
- CLI client now exposes explorer functionality as `explore` sub commands of the CLI client;
- Raw JSON-encoded conditions can now be used instead of addresses in wallet send sub commands of the CLI client;
- Locked and unlocked unspent outputs can now be listed using the `wallet list` sub commands of the CLI client;
- Atomic swap CLI client commands usage and terminology have been aligned with decred atomic swap tools;
- Atomic swap CLI client commands have received several bug fixes;

## Upgrade concerns

- the `--legacy` and `--locktime` flags have been removed from the wallet send commands as well as the fact that the REST `POST /wallet/coin` and `POST /wallet/blockstakes` no longer take a version as argument. If your technology does still give a version argument, not to worry, it will simply be ignored, and `version: 1` will be used instead, as should have been your choice already anyhow.
- `atomicswap claim` command has been renamed to `atomicswap redeem` and takes now only 2 positional arguments: `<outputid> <secret>`;
- `atomicswap audit` command has been renamed to `atomicswap auditcontract` and takes now only 1 positional argument: `<outputid>`;
- `atomicswap auditcontract` command has now flag arguments (`--secrethash`, `--amount`, `--sender`, `--min-duration`) allowing you to automatically validate certain or most properties of the found atomic swap contract, as part of printing the contract to the STDOUT;
- `atomicswap extractsecret` takes now the positional argument(s) `<transactionid> [outputid]` instead of `outputid [hashedsecret]`;
- `atomicswap extractsecret` has now a flag argument `--secrethash`, allowing you to automatically validate the extrated secret prior to returning it;
- `atomicswap refund` takes now only 1 positional argument: `<outputid>`;
- The CLI client no longer supports the creation of v0 transactions, but can still understand them when already created;
- The atomic swap CLI client commands no longer support v0-transaction atomic swap contracts in any way;
