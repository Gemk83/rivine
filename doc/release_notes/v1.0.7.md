# Releasenotes Rivine v1.0.7

## Summary

- Bug fixes:
  - fix consensus command progress estimation;
  - minimum miner fees are now enforced in both consensus as well as transaction pool, for all transactions (#400);
  - wallet methods, endpoints and commands now return a clear error in case the wallet is locked while an unlocked wallet is required (#382);
  - fix a couple of bugs in the consensus and block creator modules (#74, #384)
  - fix the panic that could be experienced upon exiting the daemon (#391);
  - reduce the time it takes for the daemon to shut down gracefully significantly;
  - align and improve the constants exposed by the server and explorer module endpoints;
  - fix a deadlock within the gateway module;
  - fix an explorer bug which caused spend outputs not to be tracked any longer (#407);
  - minor fix in gateway to make it handle `localhost` appropriately;
  - fix deadlock in transactionBuilder that could be experienced when auto-signing a nil-condition;
- Improvements:
  - improve `--help` documentation and error handling of the atomic swap CLI commands;
  - improve the condition/fulfillment usage code, such that we rely less on the actual Golang type and more on the combination of its condition/fulfillment type and expected interface (#406)
  - wallet endpoints have improved HTTP error/status codes;
  - Make CLI client as stateless as possible, defaulting to hard-coded config only when no config could be fetched from the daemon (#402 and #400);
  - make the transaction pool constants configurable together with the rest of the blockchain constants;
  - demote transaction type v0 to be a normal transaction, which can be overridden and customized just as the v1 type can be overridden;
- Features:
  - `GET /explorer/hash` endpoint can now also look in the transaction pool for unconfirmed transactions (#381);
  - `GET /transactionpool/transactions` now has an optional query parameter `unlockhash` to only return the transactions from the pool which are related to the given unlock hash (#387);

## Upgrade concerns

- as a minimum value for miner fees are now enforced, you'll have to be careful for existing chain. If you use Rivine as a library, you're safest option is to overwrite the default (and if used legacy) transaction version(s) such that you can add a custom rule to only validate the miner fee in the consensus since a certain block height;
