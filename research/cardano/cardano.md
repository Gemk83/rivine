# Cardano

Very interesting [principles and concept](./cardano_concept.md)

## Status

## Proof of Stake

Delegated staking is being rolled out in an incenticived **testnet**

## Wallet

### Reference wallet Daedalus

Supports basic sending and receiving and the delegated staking for the testnet.

It is a full node desktop client that requires syncing with the chain. Requires 7+ GB at the time of writing(epoch 162 slot 19620).

### Other wallets

Hardware, light and mobile wallets exist that support Cardano(ADA).

## Roadmap

Smart contracts, scaling and governance are still under development.
